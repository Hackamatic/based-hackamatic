   - Have your hackathon bounty link ready
   - Open Cursor IDE
   - Open the chat tab by clicking on the chat icon on the left or by pressing `Ctrl+L`
   - Select the Composer tab and toggle the `agent` switch to on
   - Type in the chat: "I want to start a new project with this bounty: [your-bounty-link]"
   - The AI will create a `BOUNTY-DESCRIPTION.md` file with analyzed requirements

2. **Project Ideation**

   - The AI will guide you through brainstorming
   - Discuss your ideas with the AI
   - Ask for suggestions and feedback
   - The AI will help document your final idea
