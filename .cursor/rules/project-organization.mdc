# Project Organization Rules

## Documentation Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview, quick start guide, and high-level information
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`: ONLY project requirements and specifications
- `docs/SETUP.md`: Development environment setup and workflow
- `docs/API.md`: API documentation and examples

## Documentation Guidelines
1. Keep documentation focused and single-purpose:
   - REQUIREMENTS.md should only contain actual requirements
   - Implementation details belong in separate documents
   - Architecture details go in ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Setup instructions go in SETUP.md

2. Documentation Updates:
   - Update relevant documentation after every significant change
   - Keep each document focused on its specific purpose
   - Don't mix implementation details with requirements

3. File Organization:
   - Source code goes in `src/`
   - Documentation goes in `docs/`
   - Cursor rules go in `.cursor/rules/`
