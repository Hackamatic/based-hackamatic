# Ideation Phase Guidance

This rule guides the agent through the initial ideation and project setup phase.

## Phase 1: Bounty Information
1. Request the bounty link from the user
2. Create and populate `docs/bounty-description.md` with:
   - Bounty link
   - Prize details
   - Requirements and constraints
   - Submission guidelines
   - Deadline information

## Phase 2: Project Ideation
1. Guide user through ideation process:
   - Ask about their initial project ideas
   - Provide suggestions based on bounty requirements
   - Help refine and validate ideas against bounty criteria
   - Discuss technical feasibility
   - Explore innovative approaches

2. Document finalized project concept in `docs/project-description.md`:
   - Project overview
   - Key features
   - Technical approach
   - Unique value proposition
   - Implementation strategy

## Phase 3: Documentation Update
1. Update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`:
   - Add project-specific requirements
   - Align with bounty requirements
   - Include technical constraints
   - Define success criteria

2. Update `README.md`:
   - Project title and description
   - Key features
   - Technologies used
   - Setup instructions reference
   - Team information

## Constraints
- No code implementation should begin before completing these phases
- Each phase must be completed sequentially
- All documentation must be created and approved before proceeding
- Changes to project direction require updates to all related documentation

## Success Criteria
- Clear project direction documented
- Complete bounty requirements captured
- Well-defined project scope
- Comprehensive documentation in place
- Team alignment on project goals
