 # Deployment Phase Guidance

This rule guides the agent through the deployment phase, ensuring proper infrastructure setup and application hosting.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. Cloud Infrastructure:
   - Select cloud provider
   - Configure cloud resources
   - Set up networking
   - Configure security groups
   - Initialize monitoring services

2. Blockchain Infrastructure:
   - Configure Base network connections
   - Set up wallet management
   - Initialize smart contract deployments
   - Configure blockchain monitoring
   - Set up transaction management

3. AI Service Infrastructure:
   - Configure AI service providers
   - Set up API access
   - Initialize model endpoints
   - Configure rate limiting
   - Set up monitoring

## Phase 2: Environment Configuration
1. Configure environments:
   - Development
   - Staging
   - Production
   - Testing

2. Environment variables:
   - Create .env templates
   - Document required variables
   - Set up secrets management
   - Configure key rotation
   - Document security policies

## Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline
1. CI/CD setup:
   - Configure build pipeline
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment stages
   - Set up rollback procedures
   - Initialize monitoring alerts

2. Deployment automation:
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Configure container orchestration
   - Set up load balancing
   - Configure auto-scaling
   - Set up health checks

## Phase 4: Application Deployment
1. Pre-deployment checklist:
   - Security audit
   - Performance testing
   - Database migrations
   - Backup procedures
   - Documentation review

2. Deployment steps:
   - Database deployment
   - Backend services
   - Frontend applications
   - Smart contracts
   - Integration verification

## Phase 5: Post-Deployment
1. Monitoring setup:
   - Application metrics
   - System metrics
   - Blockchain metrics
   - AI service metrics
   - User analytics

2. Maintenance procedures:
   - Backup schedules
   - Update procedures
   - Security patches
   - Performance optimization
   - Resource scaling

## Documentation Requirements
1. Infrastructure documentation:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Network topology
   - Security measures
   - Access controls
   - Recovery procedures

2. Deployment documentation:
   - Deployment procedures
   - Configuration guides
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Monitoring guides
   - Maintenance procedures

## Constraints
- All infrastructure must be documented
- Security best practices must be followed
- Automated deployment required
- Monitoring must be comprehensive
- Backup procedures must be tested
- Recovery plans must be documented

## Success Criteria
- Successful deployment to all environments
- All monitoring systems active
- Security measures verified
- Backup systems tested
- Documentation complete
- Team trained on procedures
- Recovery plans validated

## Emergency Procedures
1. Incident response:
   - Error detection
   - Impact assessment
   - Communication plan
   - Resolution steps
   - Post-mortem analysis

2. Recovery procedures:
   - Service restoration
   - Data recovery
   - System rollback
   - Communication protocols
   - Incident documentation
